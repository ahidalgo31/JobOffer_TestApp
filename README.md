NOTES ABOUT THIS PROJECT:

- In order to perform CRUD operations I used ADO.NET. 
- The data entry for Items and Attributes was made directly into the tables due timing constraint. 
- A UI was designed in order to Crete, Update, Delete, View Items and Search Groups. This is located in the default Routing path.
- For IoC Container I used Unity Framework.  
- For Unit Testing I only added two test method using mocking framework. I think the most important thing is to demostrate the 
  understanding of this design pattern.
- For this project I used Visual Studio Community 2013 and SQL Server 2012. 
- The DB Schema and Data Scripts are included in a separate folder outside the solution structure. 

Thanks, 
Adriano.
