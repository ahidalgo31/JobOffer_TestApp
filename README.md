NOTES ABOUT THIS PROJECT:

- IN ORDER TO PERFORM CRUD OPERATIONS I USED ADO.NET.
- THE DATA ENTRY FOR ITEMS AND ATTIBUTES WAS MADE DIRECTLY INTO THE TABLES DUE TIMING CONSTRAINTS. 
- A UI WAS DESIGNED IN ORDER TO CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, VIEW ITEMS AND SEARCH GROUPS. THIS IS LOCATED IN THE DEFAULT ROUTE PATH. 
- FOR IoC CONTAINER I USED UNITY FRAMEWORK. 
- FOR UNIT TESTING I ONLY ADDED TWO TEST METHOD USING MOCKING FRAMEWORK. I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO DEMOSTRATE THE    
  UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THIS DISIGN PATTERN. 
- THE DB CREATING AND DATA SCRIPTS ARE INCLUDED IN A SEPARATE FOLDER OUTSIDE THE SOLUTION STRUCTURE. 


THANKS, 
ADRIANO.
